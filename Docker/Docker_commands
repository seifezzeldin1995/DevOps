Each container has its own set of namespaces[PID,USER,UTS,NS,NET,IPC]
UTS is hostname and domain name, NS mount points, IPC is inter-process communication
MNT - Mount and unmount directories without affecting other namespaces.
cgroup controls limits and monitor of resources
Container are process run on shared kernel
Docker is tooling to manage containers, package dependencies with containers
# docker container run -t ubuntu top
//-t flag allocates a pseudo-TTY, which you need for the top to work correctly
run new container and ssh the ip address of first terminal
get container ID use #docker container ls -la
//Using docker container exec with bash is a common pattern to inspect a docker container.
# docker container exec -it <Cont_ID> bash

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Run multiple containers, nginx server
$ docker container run --detach --publish 8080:80 --name nginx nginx
//The --detach flag will run this container in the background. 
The publish flag publishes port 80 in the container (the default port for nginx), using port 8080 on our host.
Remember that the NET namespace gives processes of the container their own network stack. 
The --publish flag is a feature that allows us to expose networking through the container onto the host.

//run a mongoDB server.
#docker container run --detach --publish 8081:27017 --name mongo mongo:3.4
#docker container inspect [container id]
//more information than ls
-----------------------------------------------------------------
clean up with 
# docker container stop [container id]
#docker system prune
