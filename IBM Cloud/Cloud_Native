# The Cloud Native Computing Foundation hosts critical components of the global technology infrastructure. 
# Founded by the Linux Foundation shortly after the release of Kubernetes 1.0 in 2015, it brings together developers and experts from influential tech companies 
to agree on guidance for developing cloud native computing technologies.

# Cloud native technologies empower organizations to build and run scalable applications in modern, dynamic environments 
such as public, private, and hybrid clouds. Containers, service meshes, microservices, immutable infrastructure, and declarative APIs exemplify this approach.

# CNCF responsibilities 
1-Stewardship of projects: Ensuring that the technologies are available to the community. 
2-Ensuring that trademarks and logos are used appropriately. 
3-ensuring that brand and image are maintained across implementations, especially for uniform user experience and compatibility across applications. 
4- Fostering the growth and evolution of the ecosystem. Evaluating additional technologies to add to the ecosystem


# Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery

- Test driven development is the practice of creating tests before writing code. This ensures that every line of code written is backed by a test.
- The next step is to write just enough code to make the test pass or green. 
- Finally, refactor the code base to eliminate any duplicate code and potentially add abstractions to make it more extensible.
- Enable faster innovation, continuous delivery
# CI/CD involves building and deploying your software so that it is always ready for production. 

# Which layer of the cloud native stack is conventionally known as middleware?  Application Runtime 
# Public and private clouds can both be hosted by external vendors. What is the main difference between these two clouds?  
External vendors maintain hosted private clouds for one organization
# What is the ultimate result of the app modernization benefits? Lower costs and developer productiveness
# The app modernization effort touches which stages of application development? 
Innovation, Agile Delivery, Cost Reduction  
# Which of these modernization patterns involve leaving the complex parts of the application as is? Expose API 
# Which of the TDD benefits leads to loosely coupled modules that work well with each other? 
Developers think of features as small code blocks tested individually
# What pattern does TDD follow? Red-green-refactor
# What does an SRE use to reveal system downtime when making changes? 
Error budgets  

#Application modernization involves building or refactoring existing legacy applications to enable them to run on the cloud.  
# Application modernization helps improve developer productivity and reduce costs.

IBM cloud  IBM Cloud is an open cloud computing platform that combines infrastructure as a service (IaaS) with platform as a service (PaaS), 
and includes a catalog of diverse cloud services, which can be used to rapidly build and deploy business applications or infrastructure.
- As a PaaS, it provides developers access to IBM software for integration, security, transaction, and other key functions, and software from IBM Business Partners. 
- IBM Cloud also allows you to deploy containers, storage, and networking resources across the world-wide data centers. 
- IBM Cloud uses Cloud Foundry, which is an open source platform as a service offering that provides a choice of clouds, frameworks, and application services.
- Cloud Foundry provides the monitoring, deployment, and logging tools for hosting apps. 
-A runtime is a set of resources that is used to run an application. 
- Each runtime features an associated build pack, which is a collection of scripts that prepare your code to run on IBM Cloud.
- Runtimes are provided by IBM or through Community Buildpacks.

-A region is a defined geographical territory to which you can deploy your applications.
-Locations are data centers within the region in which hardware is deployed. Locations are not specified during application deployment. 
-To meet certain countriesâ€™ data security requirements, select the region where you are required to store the application data. 
- For high availability, select multiple regions. If your application fails in one region, it is still available on another region. 
- Cloud Foundry uses the Diego architecture to manage the application life-cycle for deploying and starting the application on Cloud Foundry.
