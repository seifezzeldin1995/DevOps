# cloud Foundry Helps you deploy applications,decouples applications from infrastructure,Language- and framework-neutral.
# IBM Cloud CLI is a general-purpose developer tool that provides access to an IBM Cloud account and services through a command-line interface (CLI).
#Cloud Foundry commands are accessible by using ibmcloud cf.
$ ibmcloud login
# login email and password
$ ibmcloud target --cf
# to ease depoyment,we use "kubernetes deployment.js"
# package provide metadata about application,run “npm install”, Node.js pulls dependencies from NPM and places them into “node_modules”
# clone app 
$ git clone https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/get-started-node
# deploy Cloud Foundry apps on IBM Cloud, you need a manifest.yml file
# The .cfignore file prevents cf push from uploading all the files and folders 
$ run ibmcloud cf push
# view details of app
$ ibmcloud cf app GetStartedNode
# To explore how your application directories are structured after they are deployed, use SSH to the deployed application by running the following command
$ ibmcloud cf ssh GetStartedNode
# orgs is  a level of abstraction to manage resources, such as service availability, quota plans, applications and custom domains
# A space provides a shared location for multiple users to deploy multiple applications.Every space belongs to one org. Each org can have multiple spaces.
# Any developer in a space can access and edit the configurations of an application.
# A buildpack is a template and tools that help you resolve your runtime dependencies.
# force and Push the application by running the following command
$ ibmcloud cf push -b BUILDPACK_NAME
# Dependencies are your runtime dependencies, that is, the programs and libraries that Node.js requires to run, [Detect, Supplies, finalize, Release]
$ ibmcloud cf buildpacks
# To use a custom buildpack, you can either:
-Add the buildpack key into the application’s manifest.yml file
-ibmcloud cf push APP_NAME -b https://github.com/cloudfoundry/java-buildpack.git
-To configure the number of instances that you want in manifest.yml, specify the number of instances in the instances key.
$ ibmcloud cf scale APP_NAME -i NUMBER_OF_INSTANCES
# Cloud Foundry manages application orchestration across multiple availability zones and infrastructure.
# If there are multiple instances of your application running, Cloud Foundry automatically load balances across instances.
# The Cloud Foundry platform provides log aggregations. To view events and logs for the deployed application, run the following commands:
$ ibmcloud cf events GetStartedNode
$ ibmcloud cf logs GetStartedNode
# setting routes
